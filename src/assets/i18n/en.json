Later, I was hired, but the responsibilities had already been in place since the first day of the internship. <br><br> On a daily basis, my work involved developing new features for the company's main website (mostly on the front-end). I also maintained and updated client websites, which were essentially the same website but each with its own custom styles."

I also used other technologies, such as Prestashop, WordPress, and Vue. <br><br> My initial task was to develop a B2B e-commerce platform, working directly with the client. Once the development was completed, I started taking charge of several projects managed by the consultancy, which included websites for booking campgrounds, e-sports tournaments, and more."

Together, we created a custom front-end architecture for the company, which we would improve over time as the team grew. <br><br> The main goal of the team is to handle the entire visual interface of the company's applications (whether internal or for clients), using Angular and Blazor as frameworks. The entire style architecture has been developed with Sass."
