        "DESCRIPTION" : "I started out doing my internship for the Web Application Development degree, but from day one I took on full-stack developer tasks, and continued in that role when I was hired after finishing the internship. <br><br> I worked on the complete development of an e-commerce platform built from scratch by the startup, which also served as the foundation for other clients, adapting its visual appearance through fine-tuned custom CSS for each one. My main responsibilities were: <br><br> <ul><li> - Developing new features such as an integrated blog system.</li> <li> - Maintaining and improving the internal admin panel, also developed in-house.</li> <li> - Deploying changes to both development and production environments, ensuring the stability of the project (for both the main project and multiple client projects).</li></ul> <br><br> It was an intense and formative period, where I had to figure things out on my own â€”literally learning by breaking stuffâ€”, but I came out much better prepared and with a clear vision of how to approach real projects in demanding environments."

The project was mainly developed with PHP and Prestashop. <br><br> After its completion, I became part of several internal projects at the consultancy, all developed in Angular. During my time there, I participated in applications from their early stages and was responsible for both implementing new features and improving existing ones in ongoing projects. <br> Agile methodologies in teams of 3-5 people."

        "DESCRIPTION" : "Since joining, Iâ€™ve been part of a fledgling front-end development team, being the second member to join. During this time, Iâ€™ve actively contributed to the evolution of both our internal and external projects. <br><br> I started by building from scratch a style architecture based on BEMIT, which is now applied as a standard across all our developments. Iâ€™ve worked on the frontend of complex web applications ranging from logistics tools to office applications and highly visual websites for clients. <br><br> Together with my teammates, Iâ€™ve contributed to designing an efficient and scalable project architecture in both Angular and Blazor. In addition to my development tasks, I provide technical support to the team: answering questions, giving small internal trainings, and conducting code reviews to foster continuous improvement, especially for junior profiles. <br><br> Iâ€™m currently still working on the teamâ€™s continuous improvement and on the evolution of the companyâ€™s front-end stack, while also directly participating in new developments."
